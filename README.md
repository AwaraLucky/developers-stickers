# developers-stickers  

## Overview  

 * A compilation of programming stickers for WhatsApp.  
 
 * If you would like to design your own stickers for WhatsApp, you can package them in an Android app.  A separate app is necessary and it will reside on your phone's home screen just like any other app. Stickers on WhatsApp must be legal, authorized, and acceptable. 
The sample code provides a simple way for you to drop in your sticker art and build an Android app with minimal development or coding experience needed.
